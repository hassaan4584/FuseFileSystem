//This is the same as the access(2) system call. It returns -ENOENT if the path doesn't exist, -EACCESS if the requested permission isn't available, or 0 for success. Note that it can be called on files, directories, or any other object that appears in the filesystem. This call is not required but is highly recommended.

NOTE: Symbolic-link support requires only readlink and symlink. FUSE itself will take care of tracking symbolic links in paths, so your path-evaluation code doesn't need to worry about it.

Many filesystems leave this call unimplemented, although technically that's a Bad Thing since it risks losing data. If you store your filesystem inside a plain file on another filesystem, you can implement this by calling fsync(2) on that file, which will flush too much data (slowing performance) but achieve the desired guarantee.
